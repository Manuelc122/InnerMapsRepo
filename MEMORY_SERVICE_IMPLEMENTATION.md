Memory Service Implementation Summary
====================================

## What's Been Implemented

1. **Service Key Management**:
   - Added `prompt-service-key` script to interactively add the Supabase service key
   - Updated scripts to use the service key for bypassing RLS policies
   - Added service key verification with `check-service-key`

2. **Memory Processing**:
   - Fixed `run-memory-service` script to process memories that need embeddings
   - Successfully generated embeddings for all memories
   - Verified database access and functionality

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README and setup guide with new instructions
   - Added troubleshooting steps for common issues

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment**:
   - Choose a deployment option (PM2, Docker, or systemd)
   - Set up the memory service to run automatically

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Use the memory dashboard to monitor the service
   - Set up alerts for any issues

3. **Testing**:
   - Create test journal entries to verify the trigger
   - Monitor memory creation and embedding generation

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Check if the service key is working
npm run check-service-key

# Run the memory service to process memories
npm run run-memory-service

# Create memories for existing journal entries
npm run create-memories

# Start the memory service with PM2
npm run start-memory-service
```
